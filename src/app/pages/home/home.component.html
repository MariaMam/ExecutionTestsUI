    Thanks for using the DevExtreme Angular App Template.

      A part of our tests within the R&D are so called “storage stability test”.

      That means we are storing products in different storage cabinets with different temperatures [Climate Condition]

      according to a time line [Periode][PeriodeDuration] = [TimeSerie]!


    From time to time (according to the TimeSerie) the products will be rated (numeric or dropdown list) by a
      specific measure Condition [measureConditionID].
      We differ between “Numeric” and “SelectionSet” Parameter:


    <ul>
      <li> pH-Value = numeric parameter [double]</li>
      <li>Appearance = SelectionSet parameter because the answers are given via a predefined DropDown list [List]</li>
    </ul>

    A part of the ER diagram looks like this:

    <ul>
      <li> Starting Point is “TestOrderMaster” represents a “test”</li>
      <li> Products are belonging to a test (1-N relationship)</li>
      <li> ExecutionTest are belonging to a product. (1-N relationship)</li>
    </ul>
   
    

    So the ExecutionTest table and related tables are very important. It contains all information to build an interface
    so that our customers can enter their test results in following way:

    <ul>
      <li> Green background means everything ok</li>
      <li> Orange background means that the entered data is out of specification.</li>      
    </ul>

    
   
    If the Parameter is from type “Numeric” the table ExecutionTest with the columns

    <ul>
      <li>[ParameterPlausibilityCheck]</li>
      <li>[ParameterPlausibilityMin]</li>   
      <li>[[ParameterPlausibilityMax]]</li>       
    </ul>    

    Are defining the border:<br>
    e.g. ParameterPlausibilityCheck = 1<br>

    ParameterPlausibilityMin = 7<br>

    ParameterPlausibilityMax = 8<br>

    If the Value = 9 then Background orange because out of range<br>

    If value = 7,5 then Background green because in Range<br>



    <p><b>The important thing is that this grid should be dynamical. That means that the count of product can change from test
    to test.

    And it is important that the product are listed in a horizontal way.</b></p>
